## Usage

### Requirements

* `nodejs`
* `npmjs`
* `docker` or `mongodb`
* `python` (to run tests)
 
### Installation

Install with `npm i`.

### Development

The server is available at `localhost:3000`.

You can run the dev environment via npm with a database on localhost. Or, if you prefer it, use
the included `compose.yaml` file.

#### npm

Make sure that there is a `mongodb` database running on `localhost:27017`.

For example:

```console
sudo docker run -p 27017:27017 --rm mongo:8.0.0-rc4
```

You can run a development server with `nodemon` via `npm start`.

```console
npm start
```

#### test

There are some python tests that check availability of routes.

```console
npm test
```

#### docker compose

```console
docker compose up --build
```
